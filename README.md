# Ok, what is this project?
# The idea is to create an API + widget to render content for
# scheduling sites. 
# Specifically, for booking tennis courtsin a tennis club
# Club software sites should be able to set up thier own
# rules for booking, embed the widget and/or render the content
# simple functions:
# set up booking rules
# set up members with tiers (full members vs pay-per-book vs guests), coaches with tiers
# set up recorring events
# admin area
# member area
# general public area
# book a court 
# render all courts with booked/unbooked slots
